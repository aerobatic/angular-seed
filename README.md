# Angular Seed Starter Template

This repo provides a solid starting point for building your own AngularJS single page app on the [Aerobatic hosting platform](http://www.aerobatic.com).
It comes preconfigured with a number of Grunt tasks including the [grunt-aerobatic](https://github.com/aerobatic/grunt-aerobatic) task used to power the Aerobatic development workflow.
Bower is used to manage client dependencies including the [angular-aerobatic](https://github.com/aerobatic/angular-aerobatic) extension library.
