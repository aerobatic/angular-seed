# Angular Seed Starter Template

This repo provides a solid starting point for building your own AngularJS single page app on the [Aerobatic HTML5 platform](http://www.aerobatic.io). This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building your own app. It comes preconfigured with a number of Grunt tasks including the [grunt-aerobatic] task used to power the Aerobatic development workflow.

## Running Tests
`grunt test`
